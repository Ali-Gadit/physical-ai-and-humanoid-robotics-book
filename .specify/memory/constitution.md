# Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics Textbook Constitution

## Core Principles

### I. Textbook Creation
Create a textbook to teach a course in Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics.

### II. AI/Spec-Driven Development
Utilize Claude Code and Spec-Kit Plus for AI/Spec-Driven Book Creation.

### III. Docusaurus & GitHub Pages
The book will be written using Docusaurus and deployed to GitHub Pages.

### IV. Integrated RAG Chatbot
Build and embed a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) chatbot within the published book. This chatbot, utilizing the OpenAI Agents/ChatKit SDKs, FastAPI, Neon Serverless Postgres database, and Qdrant Cloud Free Tier, must be able to answer user questions about the book's content, including answering questions based only on text selected by the user.

### V. Reusable Intelligence (Bonus)
Incorporate Claude Code Subagents and Agent Skills for reusable intelligence to earn bonus points.

### VI. User Authentication & Personalization (Bonus)
Implement Signup and Signin using Better-Auth.com. Collect user's software and hardware background at signup to personalize content.

### VII. Content Personalization (Bonus)
Allow logged users to personalize chapter content via a button at the start of each chapter.

### VIII. Content Translation (Bonus)
Enable logged users to translate chapter content into Urdu via a button at the start of each chapter.
