# Introduction to Physical AI and Embodied Intelligence

## What is Physical AI?

Physical AI represents a fundamental shift from traditional artificial intelligence systems that operate purely in digital spaces to AI systems that function in the physical world and comprehend physical laws. This emerging field focuses on creating AI that can interact with and understand the real world through sensors, actuators, and embodied agents like robots.

The future of AI extends beyond digital spaces into the physical world. This capstone quarter introduces Physical AI—AI systems that function in reality and comprehend physical laws. Students learn to design, simulate, and deploy humanoid robots capable of natural human interactions using ROS 2, Gazebo, and NVIDIA Isaac.

## Understanding Embodied Intelligence

Embodied intelligence is the concept that intelligence emerges from the interaction between an agent and its environment. Unlike traditional AI models confined to digital environments, embodied intelligence systems learn and adapt through physical interaction with the world around them.

Humanoid robots are poised to excel in our human-centered world because they share our physical form and can be trained with abundant data from interacting in human environments. This represents a significant transition from AI models confined to digital environments to embodied intelligence that operates in physical space.

## Why Physical AI Matters

Physical AI is crucial for several reasons:

1. **Real-world Interaction**: Physical AI systems can perform tasks in real environments, from manufacturing floors to homes, hospitals, and disaster zones.

2. **Understanding Physical Laws**: These systems must understand physics, gravity, collisions, and material properties to operate effectively in the physical world.

3. **Human-Robot Collaboration**: Physical AI enables robots to work alongside humans in shared spaces, requiring safety, communication, and coordination.

4. **Sensor Integration**: Physical AI systems must process multiple sensor modalities simultaneously, including vision, touch, sound, and proprioception.

5. **Adaptive Learning**: Through physical interaction, these systems can learn from real-world experiences rather than just simulated or digital data.
