# Assessment Methods

## Overview

This course employs a comprehensive assessment strategy that evaluates both theoretical understanding and practical application of Physical AI and humanoid robotics concepts. Our assessment methods are designed to measure student learning outcomes through multiple modalities, ensuring that students develop both technical proficiency and conceptual understanding.

The assessment approach emphasizes hands-on learning, project-based evaluation, and continuous feedback to support student growth throughout the 13-week course.

## Assessment Philosophy

Our assessment philosophy is grounded in authentic evaluation that mirrors real-world robotics development challenges. We believe that effective assessment should:

- Measure both knowledge acquisition and skill application
- Provide timely and constructive feedback
- Support diverse learning styles and abilities
- Align with industry practices and expectations
- Foster continuous improvement and learning
