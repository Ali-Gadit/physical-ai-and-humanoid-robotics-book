## Prompt

/sp.clarify

## Response snapshot

No critical ambiguities detected worth formal clarification. All key aspects of the specification appear clear and well-defined for the current phase. The feature is ready for the next phase. Suggested next command: `/sp.plan`


## Outcome

- ✅ Impact: Spec reviewed for ambiguities, none found for immediate clarification.
- 🧪 Tests: No tests run during clarification.
- 📁 Files: `spec.md` reviewed.
- 🔁 Next prompts: `/sp.plan`
- 🧠 Reflection: Successfully ran the clarification check and determined no critical ambiguities required immediate user input. The specification is considered clear for planning.
