## Prompt

sp.tasks

## Response snapshot

The tasks for "AI/Spec-Driven Book Creation: Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics Textbook" have been generated, outlining the implementation steps, dependencies, and parallel execution opportunities.

## Outcome

- ✅ Impact: Tasks generated and validated based on spec and plan.
- 🧪 Tests: No tests run during task generation.
- 📁 Files: `tasks.md` created.
- 🔁 Next prompts: `/sp.implement`
- 🧠 Reflection: Successfully generated the detailed task list for the Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics Textbook, covering setup, foundational elements, user stories, and deployment. The tasks are structured for incremental delivery and parallel execution where possible.

## Evaluation notes (flywheel)

- Failure modes observed: None
- Graders run and results (PASS/FAIL): PASS
- Prompt variant (if applicable): N/A
